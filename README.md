# rust-vulkan 

Found a nice set of guides on using something called [Ash](https://crates.io/crates/ash) (I think) which allows the creation of Vulkan programs in Rust.  At the moment I just want to try and follow through this tutorial and see if I can make any sense of it. I started this as all my other stuff is trapped on my old machine and at some point I have to copy it all back across!

Tutorial I'm following is this [ashen-aeten](https://hoj-senna.github.io/ashen-aetna/text/001_Plan.html)

This is my [current page](https://hoj-senna.github.io/ashen-aetna/text/006_Window.html) if I remembered to update the link!

## Progress Log ##
24-5-2024 Started work, setup the repo and made a start on the reading. 
30-7-2024 Finished off the validation layer, lots of distractions so might want to go back and revisit this. I need to look up the "builder pattern" and try and use this in my stuff.
31-7-2024 Finihsed the Physical Devices section, currently a little limited as it goes for the last descrete graphics card. No fall back to the onboard if there isn't one! Also worked through the section on Queues, created a virtual graphics device. Next section is bafflingly called A window?
