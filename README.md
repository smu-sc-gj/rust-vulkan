# rust-vulkan 

Found a nice set of guides on using something called [Ash](https://crates.io/crates/ash) (I think) which allows the creation of Vulkan programs in Rust.  At the moment I just want to try and follow through this tutorial and see if I can make any sense of it. I started this as all my other stuff is trapped on my old machine and at some point I have to copy it all back across!

Tutorial I'm following is this [ashen-aeten](https://hoj-senna.github.io/ashen-aetna/text/001_Plan.html)

This is my [current page]() if I remembered to update the link!
